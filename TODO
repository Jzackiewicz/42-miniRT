1. Parsing accepts negative diameter.
2. Ambient doesn't work in lightining
3. Ambient color not taken into account in assign_object_material
4. Check every case where coordinates direction matters -> default camera forward orientation in book is z=-1; I assumed z=1 :v
5. Fisheye effect is a thing and maybe we wanna get rid of this. It kind of makes it hard to check whether the light is projected correctly
5.1 FOV acts funny at 180
